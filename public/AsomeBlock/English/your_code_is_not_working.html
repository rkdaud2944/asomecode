                        1. Make sure the AsomeBoard's red light is on. If the red light does not come on, then the board is faulty.<br/>
                        2. Make sure that the parts are assembled correctly.<br/> 
                        3. Check if there is an error in the result window.<br/>
                        &nbsp;○ If there is an error, then there is a problem with the code.<br/>
                        &nbsp;○ Make sure that the last code you entered is correct.<br/>
                        &nbsp;○ If you still get an error, click the [Update] button to make AsomeBoard reset and try again.<br/>
                        4. Unplug the USB cable from the computer and plug it back in. Then click the [Connect] button on upper left corner.
